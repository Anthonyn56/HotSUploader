/**
 * The AWS credentials for the public HotsLogs S3 bucket.
 * DEAR READER: These are public, and this is very much intended. We understand your concerns about security, but given
 * the current technological environment, it is impossible to hide this from anyone who wants to inspect the memory of
 * the application. In fact, Java debuggers have gotten so advanced that it is trivial. Therefore, the security of this
 * key rests solely on proper restrictions having been placed on it. We, the developers, have not personally verified
 * this, but trust the developer of HotsLogs has done the correct amount of work.
 *
 * If you wish to further inquire about ideas for improving the security model of this layer, please email
 * {@literal mail@eivind.ninja} with {@literal admin@hotslogs.com} on CC.
